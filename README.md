# RetailStoreApp-iOS

Personal project:
This is a basic structure for a RetailStore.
The retail store is trying to come up with a mobile app for its customers that can
help customers browse products and create a cart with products that they
wish to purchase.

The main focus of the project is 
- Good Object mode
- Reusable components
- Persistance

The project is fully made of swift 3
CoreData for persistance
and with minimalistic UI.

There are no networks layers yet,
Hence the complete data is mocked up
